# JavaScript-Game-Development-1

Overview: 

This is a 2d point and shoot game that I learned how to develop from the
JavaScript Game Development For Beginners Course on Youtube.com. The
goal of the game is to shoot as many ravens as possible before they
reach the other side to end the game. My highest kill score was 42.
